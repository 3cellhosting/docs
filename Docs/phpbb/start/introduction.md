What is phpBB?
-----

![][introduction]

**phpBB** is one of the most popular and widely used open source bulletin board systems currently available. Forums are powered by [phpBB][phpbb] that cater to virtually any sized audience from a handful of users per month to thousands per day.

Sites powered by phpBB are frequently used to provide support, facilitate community interaction, and are even useful for small, collaborative teams searching for a platform where multiple discussions can be easily searched and read.

phpBB is released under the [GNU Public License][gnu] and can be modified and expanded upon.

phpBB as a Solution
-----

phpBB is typically a great complementary part of a larger website. For example, you can host a primary site through Joomla and, using RokBridge, enable your users to search for and share information through your phpBB boards. Your primary site could play host to the main content body of your site while the forum exists to make it easier for members of your community to ask questions, find answers, and converse about topics relative to your main site's product and/or services.

phpBB is often deployed in internal enterprise environments where coworkers, remote and local, can collaborate and discuss ideas surrounding a number of different topics. This type of interaction is more open and easier to navigate than a chat room where topics change frequently and long-form content is harder to manage.

Many companies use forums as part of a greater support system. Because phpBB is easily searched and organized, questions that are brought up by users can be answered, kept at the top of pages, and expanded upon by other members of the board.

-----
