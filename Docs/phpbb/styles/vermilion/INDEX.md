![][fontawesome]

Vermilion supports updated Font Awesome 4+ based scalable 350 vector icons, removing the need for images, for better integration and site performance. Other benefits include not needing language imagesets, as the text have been replaced by pictographs, making your forum more accessible.

### Parallax

![][parallax]

Parallax is the apparent motion of a 3D object as based against your perspective, in short, an object appears to move as your glance changes. This effect has been transposed into the full page's background image, as varying between presets.
