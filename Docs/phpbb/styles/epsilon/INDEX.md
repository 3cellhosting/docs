Introduction
-----

Epsilon is a modern, sectioned based design, with a diverse infusion of background textures and patterns. These enrich and differentiate your forum whilst maintaining an overall conservative approach, for flexible site application.

### Flat Design

![][flat]

Epsilon features a flat design that combines simplicity with modern, aesthetic appeal. This style type creates a visually clean look, without sacrificing that unique appeal that sets your site apart.

### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

![][webfonts]

Epsilon supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### RokBridge Support

![][rokbridge]

RokBridge is a non-invasive, bi-directional bridge for Joomla and phpBB3. It allows for the easy integration of the two platforms, providing registration, user syncing and login sessions syncing. The bridge is a Joomla application and not a component, so it runs standalone for performance purposes. Please visit the [RokBridge product page][rokbridge] for support and latest news.
