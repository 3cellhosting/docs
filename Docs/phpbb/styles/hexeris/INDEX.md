### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

Hexeris supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### RokBridge Support

RokBridge is an attempt to bring back famous component into the newest Joomla 2.5/3.x environment. RokBridge is a non-invasive, bi-directional bridge for Joomla and the forum platform phpBB.
