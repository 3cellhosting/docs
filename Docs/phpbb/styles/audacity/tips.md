Introduction
-----

The **Audacity** design for phpBB comes with several features that set it apart from other phpBB styles. We have outlined some tips and tricks to help you make the most of the style below.

Modules
-----

Our demo of **Audacity** features several modules which demonstrate what you can do with Audacity in phpBB 3.1. If you would like to replicate these modules, we recommend downloading the **RocketLauncher** and installing it on a local test server. There, you will have access to the source files and settings for these modules so you can easily replicate them. Alternatively, you can build your site based on the RocketLauncher and modify these modules to meet your individual needs.

You can find the Twig files used to create the modules in the `phpbb_root/styles/your_style/template/modules` directory. For a specific module, you will want to find the Twig file with the same name of the module you wish to replicate. For example, the module titled `Birthdays` is loaded from `phpbb_root/styles/your_style/template/modules/birthdays.html.twig`.

If you would like more information on how these modules are assembled and installed in phpBB 3.1, check out our [RokBB user guide](../../start/user_guide.md).
