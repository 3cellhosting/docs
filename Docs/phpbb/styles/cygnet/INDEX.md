### Modules Editor

Modules Editor allows you to easily build your modules around phpBB 3.1 forum. You can specify position, size and other params. We have included many pre-made modules and created tutorial about building your own content modules.

### Animated Header

The style benefits from an animated header, using the Particles.js script to generate connected random lines and dots that move and rotate in the header area. This can be replaced by a static image equivalent, or a custom image via the RokBB.
