### Flat Design

![][flat]

Lexicon is centered around a flat design approach, spruced by professional and engaging color schemes to create presence for site content without distracting from it. Ideal for showcasing product details in a vibrant but elegant fashion.

### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

![][webfonts]

Lexicon supports WebFonts based scalable vector icons, removing the need for images, for better integration and site performance. Other benefits include not needing language imagesets, as the text have been replaced by pictographs, making your forum more accessible.

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### Imageset Editor

![][imageset]

Lexicon supports Imageset Editor for previously implemented WebFonts based scalable vector topic icons. All icons are based on Font Awesome. Font Awesome is a pictographic language of web-related actions which delivers over 300 icons.
