### What Does Lifetime Support Mean?

Single-template purchases, in addition to other possible purchasing options may include **Lifetime** access to downloads, updates, and support. This enables you to download the product as much as you need, receive regular updates, and access related members-only support forums throughout the lifetime of the product.

This means that you are not restricted by a set length of time as you are with Club memberships that only span a specific amount of time.

If a product should become deprecated, and no longer made available for purchase, it will be deemed **Legacy**. Once a product is considered Legacy, it will be considered expired and the original purchaser may no longer have access to downloads, or any related support forums.

You can find more information about single-template purchases and Club memberships [here][comparison].

### What is a Site License?

Site Licenses (previously known as Entitlements) refer to the number of instances (sites) that can use our templates/themes. We created this system in order to make it easier for the owner of a single site to afford our products without having to pay the same rate as someone creating and managing many different sites. This is the best way we have found to ensure that our pricing model is accessible for everyone.

You can find our complete guide to site licenses [here][licenses].

### What Counts as an Incident for Premier Support?

An incident is a specific issue for which support is being requested. This restriction is put in place to avoid *incident creep* in which a variety of unrelated issues are being addressed in one support request.

For example: If you are needing assistance configuring a template for your site, a separate incident would need to be filed for setup and configuration of RokSprocket.
