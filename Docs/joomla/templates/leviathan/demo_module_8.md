    <p><strong>Leviathan</strong>, the January 2013 template release, is a visually enriched design with stunning graphics, contrasts and tones. Its sidebar adds focus and boldness, that complements and contrasts with the mainbody area to great effect.</p>
    <p class="visible-large">The core of the template is based on the Gantry Framework, which provides a plethora of standardized features and functions. Also included is support for extensions such as RokSprocket.</p>
    <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=108" class="readon"><span>Read More</span></a>
