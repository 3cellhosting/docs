![][dropdown]
The Dropdown Menu is an advanced CSS driven dropdown menu system. It offers advanced structural features such as multiple columns, inline icons and text, inline modules and positions, custom column widths, item distribution and menu offsets. All of these are configurable for each menu item.

For mobile devices, a basic version of the dropdown Menu will be used. It is activated by a custom menu icon in the top left of the screen. It will either be a tree view or select box menu, as configurable. All other sizes will use the menu's full version.
