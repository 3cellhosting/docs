Social Icons
-----
![][demo]

:   1. **Social Buttons** [8%, 48%, se]

The social buttons found in this area of the front page are the result of the **Social Icons** feature which can be activated through **Template Settings**. We have detailed the specific settings used in our demo in the [**Template Settings**][template] area of this guide.

To put it simply, you can navigate to **Administrator -> Extensions -> Template -> Corvus -> Features** and turn the **Social Buttons** feature on. You can insert URLs specific to your social network pages and assign this feature a position. In our demo, the feature is assigned the **top-a** position.
