This area of the front page is a standard **mod_custom** module. The settings we used in the demo are listed below.

>> Any **mod_custom** (Custom HTML) modules are best handled using either RokPad or no editor as a WYSIWYG editor can cause issues with any code that exists in the **Custom Output** field.
