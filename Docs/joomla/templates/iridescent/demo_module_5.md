FP RokSprocket Features - Showcase
-----

![][demo]

The **RokSprocket Features** module used near the top of the front page is a great way to feature some of your site's more notable articles or areas of interest.

We utilized the **Simple** Content Provider, allowing us to create custom content independent of full articles. The **Title**, **Description**, and **Image** fields in each article have been altered. A few examples of these article changes can be found below, excluding the **Image** and **Link** fields which will likely not work on your local copy as the links will be different.
