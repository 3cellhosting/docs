### Responsive Layout
![][responsive]
Graffito's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems -- each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

### Powered by Gantry 4 Framework
![][gantry4]
Graffito is the first RocketTheme template built on the Gantry4 Framework with a new, faster administration UI. One of the other exciting new features is the ability to use LESS CSS to make developing templates easier, more flexible, and overall, more enjoyable.

### Responsive Layout for RokSprocket
