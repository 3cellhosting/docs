Hosting
======
Joomla, like any web-based technology, needs to be hosted somewhere in order for you to use it. You can host Joomla on several different platforms ranging from your personal computer to a series of redundant data centers placed strategically around the world. Most small sites opt to have Joomla hosted via a shared or managed hosting plan set up with a commercial provider. These providers set data centers up, complete with server hardware, software, and a user-friendly Web-based interface that enables you to manage your server from anywhere in the world. Often, this comes at a very low price, with the option to upgrade to dedicated server hardware and redundant global reach at a premium.

If you're just wanting to get started with Joomla and build your site before jumping to a publically-accessible hosting solution, then the answer can be as simple as setting one up on your personal computer. All you need to do this is compatible hosting software and a little time to set up. 

Here are a list of programs you can use to set up your own Joomla-capable server at home:

Having your own server is a great way to get started, build a site in the privacy of your own network, and avoid paying for hosting services when you aren't even ready to put them to use just yet. This solution is temporary, however, as launching a site generally requires that you find some way to host it from a server located in a data center or at least connected to the Internet from a provider that allows Web hosting. Most home Internet providers have a clause that prevents you from hosting websites and services without paying extra for a commercial account.

Thankfully, remote hosting services are available for prices as low as what you might expect to spend on a cup of coffee per month. If your site expects to have a higher traffic load, or needs a more powerful server than a shared hosting solution can provide, you can opt to upgrade to a dedicated hosting plan. These usually come complete with your own remotely-managed Windows or Linux server, for a reasonable fee.

If you're building a site for a business with a little more cash to spend, you could even go so far as to purchase and manage your own server. There are plenty of colocation data centers out there that will rent rack spaces to you at a reasonable fee. Doing this allows you to create and manage your server architecture entirely in-house. It can be both the most flexible and expensive solution.
