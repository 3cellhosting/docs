RokGallery is a revolutionary ground-up gallery extension developed to be highly flexible, versatile, and user friendly. The system itself is built on a custom tag-based architecture with the ability to have multiple tag-based galleries.

RokGallery uses design and concepts that have been traditionally reserved for platform-native applications and are for the first time making their way into a web environment.
