RokPad is packed with features that make it the most powerful text editor for Joomla. In this quick breakdown, we will provide video demonstrations of some of the things you can do with RokPad.

## Multiple Cursors / Selection

To start using multiple cursors, just hold down **CMD** on Mac or **CTRL** on Windows and click anywhere in the document you want the additional cursor to be placed.

You can also perform a vertical selection by holding down the **OPT/ALT** key.

## Universal Tag Insertion

The Universal Tag Insertion ([icon]) shortcode is a preset of shortcode that allows to quickly type an open-closed tag (div, p, li, etc...) very quickly.

## Extended Buttons with Multiple Selection

The Multiple Cursors functionality allows Joomla! Extended Buttons to gain advantage from it, without doing anything else. In fact, you just need to have multiple selections and you can, for example, drop a **RokCandy** macro multiple times in one single go!

## Advanced Search and Replace

The **Search** and **Search and Replace** features are incredibly advanced in RokPad. You can find a term within a selection, find all the terms in the document, replace text, use RegExp, and more.

## Fold/Unfold of Code

Sometimes, having to deal with a lot of HTML in the editor causes confusion. With the folding and unfolding of code functionality, you can easily collapse tags and get in the 'distraction free' mode you need.
