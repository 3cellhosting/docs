### Tabs

![][tabs]

Tabs is a tabbed content display mode, presenting content in dynamically sizing tabs.

![][tabs_1]

:   1. **Filtered Article List Options** Gives you access to item-specific settings for the articles title, description, image, and link. [50%, 50%, sw]
    2. **Content Filter Rules** Sets the content filter rules for the module. [50%, 78%, sw]

1. The **Filtered Article List** gives you access to item-specific settings including:

    * **Tab Label** - By default, the article title is used as the tab label, though you can change it using this option.
    * **Description** - Allows you to set a description for the item. If this is left at *Default* the introtext from the article is used. 
    * **Icon** - This allows you to set an icon (generally a small, squared image) which will be placed next to the article title in the module.
    * **Link** - If set, the link will show a **Read More** button as well as link the title. This is the article introtext by default.

3. The **Content Filter Rules** section gives you the ability to determine how the module will pull content to make up the items. For example, you can have the module pull articles that are within a specific category, contain a particular name or keyword in the title, or choose specific articles. You can also modify how this content is sorted in the module.

Below the **Content Filter Rules** section are two options areas specific to the layout mode you have chosen. We have broken down the **Tabs Layout Options** and **Tabs Article Defaults** sections below.
