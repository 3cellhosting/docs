The **Quotes** layout mode makes it easy to display sleek, elegant quotes on your site. It is perfect for testimonials, product reviews, and inspirational messages.

>> NOTE: We recommend using the **Simple** content provider with the Quotes layout mode.

![][layout_1]

:   1. **Title** This is the title of your module. [20%, 12%, se]
    2. **Show Title** Determines whether the title of the module will appear for visitors or remain hidden. [20%, 61%, sw]
    3. **Status** Sets the publishing status for the module. [30%, 63%, nw]
    4. **Access** Sets the access level for the module. [20%, 81%, se]
    5. **Filtered Article List Options** Gives you access to item-specific settings for the articles title, description, image, and link. [50%, 55%, sw]
    6. **Content Filter Rules** Sets the content filter rules for the module. [48%, 82%, sw]

1. The **Title** field gives you the ability to set a title for the module itself. Every module has to have a title, though you can opt to hide it from public view for a cleaner, more template integrated look. The **Position** field right below it gives you the ability to set the position within the template's layout the module should appear in.

2. The **Show Title** option gives you the ability to determine whether or not the title of the module will appear with the module on the frontend.

3. The **Status** option allows you to determine the current publishing status of the module. An unpublished module will still appear on the backend for administrators, but will not appear on the live site.

4. The **Access** option gives you the ability to determine which user group will be able to see the module on the frontend. Someone logged in as a registered user may be able to see a module set at that level while random visitors do not see it.

5. The **Filtered Article List** gives you access to item-specific settings including:

    * **Quote Text** - This is where you would insert the text you want to appear in the main quote area of the item. You can use HTML here to further customize the look of the text.
    * **Image** - This allows you to circumvent the assigned image from the article and replace it with one specifically for the item. 
    * **Author** - This field enables you to place (with HTML, if you prefer) the author/source of the quote that appears below the main quote area.
    * **Subtext** - The subtext appears along with the author's name and is a great place to put the author's title, company name, and/or any additional information.
    * **Link** - If set, the link will show a **Read More** button as well as link the title. On specific themes, it will link the image in the item, as well.
    * **Direction** - Do you want the quote bubble to originate from a specific direction? You can set this here.

6. The **Content Filter Rules** section gives you the ability to determine how the module will pull content to make up the quotes. For example, you can have the module pull articles that are within a specific category, contain a particular name or keyword in the title, or choose specific articles. You can also modify how this content is sorted in the module.

Below the **Content Filter Rules** section are two options areas specific to the layout mode you have chosen. We have broken down the **Quotes Layout Options** and **Grids Article Defaults** sections below.
