Introduction
-----
RokUpdater allows you to download the latest versions of your favorite RocketTheme extensions from within your site's Joomla administrator without having to download the update directly from RocketTheme's site. It both stores and utilizes your club membership credentials in order to facilitate the download and installation of these updates with minimal effort on the part of the site administrator.
