Introduction
-----
The Popup Module feature is made possible with RokBox and is featured in numerous Gantry-powered RocketTheme templates. This feature enables you to position a module within a popup for enhanced visual presentation and added effect.

Using this feature is fairly straightforward, and can be done with just about any module type. In general, a button is set in a position on your site which activates the popup module, loading any module set to the `popup` position.

>> Note: Before beginning any of the steps below, you should make sure you have the latest version of [RokBox Plugins][rokbox] installed and activated on your site.

1. In your Administrator panel, navigate to **Extensions → Template Manager** and select your default RocketTheme template.

2. In the **Features** tab, set the **Popup Panel** option to **On**.

3. Set the position to where you would like the popup activation button to appear on your site. You can also set the button text that will let the user know what that button does.

4. **Save** your changes and close the **Template Manager**. 

5. Navigate to **Extensions → Module Manager** and create or select the module you wish to assign to a RokBox popup.

6. Assign it to the `popup` module position.

7. **Save** your changes and publish the module.
