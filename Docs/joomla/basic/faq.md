### How do I know which version of Gantry I have installed on my site?

There are a few different ways to find out. In both **Joomla 2.5** and **3.x**, go to **Admin-> Extensions -> Template Manager** and open your tempalte. Then, you will want to click the **Overview** tab.

There should be an info box on the right-hand side that tells you which version of Gantry you are currently running, and if there is an update available.

Another option would be to go to **Admin -> Extensions -> Extensions Manager** and use the **Filter** to find **Gantry**. The version will appear in this list.

### I am not seeing any changes on my Joomla site after editing something.

* In **Joomla 3.x**, go to your **Admin -> System -> Clear Cache**.
