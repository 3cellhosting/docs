Adding Content to Your Joomla Site
=========
An **article** is the most basic unit of content in Joomla. Articles make up the majority of the sheer content of most Joomla sites. They are often organized into article **categories**, which then can be used to assist in sorting, presenting, and syndicating specific types of articles differently. Categories can be nested within one-another, but no one category or article can exist within multiple separate categories.

Let's say your site is all about recipes. You might have a recipe for pesto exist as a single article, but that article can be placed within the Sauce category which itself is in the Italian category. Your pesto article will appear as a result from queries made for either category. 

Creating an article is the first step in adding content to your Joomla site.

How to Create a New Article
---------
The first step to creating a new article is to navigate to the **Article Manager's** Add a New Article page. This can be done using the admin menu at the top of the Administrator side of your Joomla site. Just navigate to **Administrator > Content > Article Manager > Add a New Article** and you should be brought to a page which includes a text editor and article-specific options (pictured below).
