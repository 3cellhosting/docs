:   1. **Gantry Extras** The sidebar appears to the right of the mainbody section. In this case, the sidebar is a **Lists** RokSprocket widget. [16%, 67%, se]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Sidebar section:

* RokSprocket

The **Gantry Extras** widget located in the sidebar section of the page is a RokSprocket Lists widget created in a very similar way to the previous RokSprocket widgets featured on the front page of the demo.

First, you'll need to create the RokSprocket Widget. You can do this by navigating to **Administration -> RokSprocket Admin** and creating a new **Lists** widget. 

You can find out more about RokSprocket and how to set up and modify widgets by visiting our [RokSprocket documentation][roksprocket].

Here is a look at the **Lists Layout Options** for this widget.

| Option              | Setting |  
| :------------------ | ------: |  
| Theme               | Default |  
| Collapsible Preview |  Enable |  
| Display Limit       |       âˆž |  
| Preview Length      |      20 |  
| Strip HTML Tags     |     Yes |  
| Previews Per Page   |       4 |  
| Arrow Navigation    |    Show |  
| Pagination          |    Show |  
| Autoplay            |       5 |  
| Image Resize        | Disable |  

You can set the RokSprocket filters to include any category, specific posts, or otherwise you'd like to have featured in this widget.

Once you've created this widget, you can add it via the Widgets menu by clicking **RokSprocket** and dragging it to the appropriate section. When you've done this, you'll need to complete the following.

* Set the **Title** to `Gantry Extras`
* Select your RokSprocket Mosaic widget in the **Choose Widget** field.
* Set the Title Variation field to **Title 1**.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

The widget should now be created and ready for use on the front page of your WordPress site.
