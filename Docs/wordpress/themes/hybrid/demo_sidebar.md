Here is the widget breakdown for the Sidebar section:

* Gantry Links

#### Gantry Login Form

The login form located on the front page is actually a **Gantry Login Form** widget. Here are the widget options you will need to change in order to match the demo.

| Option            | Setting                         |  
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ |  
| Title             | `Login Form`                    |  
| User Greeting     | Hi,                             |  
| Pre-text          | Blank                           |  
| Post-text         | Blank                           |  
| Title Variation   | Title 5                         |  

#### Gantry Links

The **Gantry Links** widget is used to display links in a way that works natively with the Gantry framework. It is a great alternative to the default WordPress blogroll widget. Links are controlled via the native **Links** feature in WordPress. You will find the options used in our demo below.
