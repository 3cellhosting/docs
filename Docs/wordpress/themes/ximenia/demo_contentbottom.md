Here is the widget breakdown for the Content Bottom section:

* RokGallery

#### RokGallery
This RokGallery widget utilizes RokBox to display images in a way that does not distract from the visual elements of the theme. RokBox is required for this feature to work.

Here is a breakdown of the widget options:

This will create the widget, but you will need to actually build the gallery using RokGallery. We go into detail on [how to use RokGallery in our official guide][rokgallery].
