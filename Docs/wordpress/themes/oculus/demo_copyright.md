Copyright Section

![][demo]

:	1. **Gantry Copyright** [35%, 6%, se]
	2. **Gantry To Top** [35%, 90%, se]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Copyright
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry To Top

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`. 

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
