:	1. **Gantry Social Buttons** [34%, 5%, se]
	2. **Gantry Logo** [34%, 45%, se]
	3. **Gantry Login Form** [34%, 65%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

* Gantry Social Buttons
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Login Form

The header section remains the same across the entire demo site. For this reason, it exists in the default **Widget Override** menu. It is also a fairly simple section to set up.

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

#### Gantry Login Form

The login form located in this area of the page is actually a **Gantry Login Form** widget. Here are the widget options you will need to change in order to match the demo.
