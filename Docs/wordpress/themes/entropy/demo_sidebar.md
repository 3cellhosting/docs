:   1. **RokNewsPager** [15%, 60%, se]
    2. **Gantry Links** [50%, 60%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Sidebar section:

#### RokNewsPager

This area of the demo is a RokNewsPager widget. RokNewsPager is no longer supported by RocketTheme. Many of its features and functionality have been integrated into [RokSprocket][roksprocket].

#### Gantry Links

The **Gantry Links** widget is used to display links in a way that works natively with the Gantry framework. It is a great alternative to the default WordPress blogroll widget. Links are controlled via the native **Links** feature in WordPress. You will find the options used in our demo below.
