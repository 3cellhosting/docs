Here's the widget breakdown for the Content Bottom section:

* RokSprocket

#### RokSprocket
The **Gantry Extras** widget located in the Content Bottom section of the page is a RokSprocket Tabs widget created in a very similar way to the previous RokSprocket widgets featured on the front page of the demo.

First, you'll need to create the RokSprocket Widget. You can do this by navigating to **Administration -> RokSprocket Admin** and creating a new **Tabs** widget. 

You can find out more about RokSprocket and how to set up and modify widgets by visiting our [RokSprocket documentation][roksprocket].

Here is a look at the **Tabs Layout Options** for this widget.

| Option          |        Setting |  
| :-------------- | -------------: |  
| Theme           |        Default |  
| Tabs Position   |            Top |  
| Display Limit   |              âˆž |  
| Animation       | Slide and Fade |  
| Autoplay        |        Disable |  
| Autoplay Delay  |              5 |  
| Image Resize    |        Disable |  
| Preview Length  |              0 |  
| Strip HTML Tags |             No |  

You can set the RokSprocket filters to include any category, specific articles, or otherwise you'd like to have featured in this widget.

Once you've created this widget, you can add it via the Widgets menu by clicking **RokSprocket** and dragging it to the appropriate section. When you've done this, you'll need to complete the following.

* Set the **Title** to `Popular Features`
* Set the **Box Variation** option to **Basic**.
* Set the **Custom Variations** field to `title5 blockfill`.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

The widget should now be created and ready for use on the front page of your WordPress site.
