Here's the widget breakdown for the Main Top section:

* RokSprocket

The Main Top section in the Kirigami demo adds a visual display of various theme features that puts images are the forefront of the front page's visual appeal.

#### RokSprocket
You'll need to do two things to prepare this widget so that it looks similar to the one in the demo.

First, you'll need to create the RokSprocket Widget. You can do this by navigating to **Administration -> RokSprocket Admin** and creating a new **Mosaic** widget. 

You can find out more about RokSprocket and how to set up and modify widgets by visiting our [RokSprocket documentation][roksprocket].

Here is a look at the **Mosaic Layout Options** for this widget.

You can set the RokSprocket filters to include any category, specific articles, or otherwise you'd like to have featured in this widget.

Once you've created this widget, you can add it via the Widgets menu by clicking **RokSprocket** and dragging it to the appropriate section. When you've done this, you'll need to complete the following.

* Select your RokSprocket Featured widget in the **Choose Widget** field.
* Set the **Box Variation** option to **Basic**.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

The widget should now be created and ready for use on the front page of your WordPress site.
