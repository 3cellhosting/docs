Copyright Section
-----
![][copyright]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Copyright
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry To Top

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Copyright
The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`. 

#### Gantry To Top
The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
