#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in the upper-left area of the front page as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### RokAjaxSearch

The RokAjaxSearch widget allows users to search your site for interesting content. Here is a breakdown of the options you will want to change to match the demo.

* Enter `fp-rokajaxsearch` in the **Custom Variations** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

#### Gantry Menu

The Gantry Menu widget should be set to match your site's main menu as it serves as the primary menu widget for the entire site. You can customize this menu by navigating to **Administration -> Appearance -> Menus** and creating or modifying your selected menu there.

Here is a breakdown of the widget options for this menu widget. Any options not present in this breakdown are left at default and should not be adjusted.
