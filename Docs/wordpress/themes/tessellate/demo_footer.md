Here is the widget breakdown for the Footer section:

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site.

Here is a breakdown of the settings we used:

| Field       | Setting                                |
| :---------- | :----------                            |
