Here is the widget breakdown for the Side Widget section:

* Custom Menu

#### Custom Menu


The **Custom Menu** widget allows us to add an extra menu somewhere on the page. This menu was created separately from the main menu linked in the header, and can be configured by going to **Administration -> Appearance -> Menus**.

Here is a breakdown of what you will need to change in the widget options to match the demo.

* Set the **Select Menu** option to match the name of the menu you wish to appear in this area.
* Leaving all other options at their default settings, click **Save**.
