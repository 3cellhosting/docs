![][demo]

:	1. **Gantry Social Buttons** [35%, 8%, se]
	2. **RokAjaxSearch** [35%, 38%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Top section:

* Gantry Social Buttons
* Gantry Divider
* RokAjaxSearch

The Top section remains the same across the entire demo site. For this reason, it exists in the default **Widget Override** menu. It is also a fairly simple section to set up.

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site. 

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### RokAjaxSearch

The RokAjaxSearch widget allows users to search your site for interesting content. Here is a breakdown of the options you will want to change to match the demo.

* Enter `fp-rokajaxsearch hidden-phone` in the **Custom Variations** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.
