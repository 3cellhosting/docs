Copyright Section

![][demo2]

:	1. **Gantry Branding** [40%, 13%, se]
	2. **Gantry To Top** [60%, 80%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Branding
* Gantry To Top

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Branding

The Gantry Branding widget does little more than display our logo at the bottom of the page. Simply click and drag the **Gantry Branding** widget into the widget section for this to appear.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it. We set the **To Top Text** to `Scroll To Top`.
