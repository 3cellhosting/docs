Here is the widget breakdown for the Showcase section:

#### RokGallery

This area of the demo is a RokGallery widget. You will need to do two things to prepare this widget so that it looks similar to the one in the demo.

First, you will need to create the RokGallery gallery. You can do this by navigating to **Administration -> RokGallery Admin** and creating a new gallery.

You can find out more about RokGallery and how to set up and modify widgets by visiting our [RokGallery documentation][rokgallery].

Here is a look at the **Features Layout Options** for this widget.
