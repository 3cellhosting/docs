    2. **RokAjaxSearch** [30%, 66%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Main Top section:

* RokNewsFlash
* Gantry Divider
* RokAjaxSearch

#### RokNewsFlash

This area of the demo is a RokNewsFlash widget. RokNewsFlash is no longer supported by RocketTheme. Many of its features and functionality have been integrated into [RokSprocket][roksprocket].

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### RokAjaxSearch

The RokAjaxSearch widget allows users to search your site for interesting content. Here is a breakdown of the options you will want to change to match the demo.

* Set the **Widget Style** option to **Flush**.
* Set the **Box Variation** option to **No Box**.
* Enter `rt-demo-search` in the **Custom Variations** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.
