Copyright Section

![][copyright]

:   1. **Gantry Copyright** [30%, 31%, se]
	2. **Custom Menu** [55%, 16%, se]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Copyright
* Custom Menu

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Â© 2013 Alerion by RocketTheme`. 

#### Custom Menu

The Custom Menu widget allows us to add an extra menu at the bottom of the page. This menu was created separately from the main menu linked in the header, and can be configured by going to **Administration -> Appearance -> Menus**.

Here is a breakdown of what you'll need to change in the widget options to match the demo.

* Set the **Select Menu** option to match the name of the menu you wish to appear in this area.
* Enter `horizmenu hidden-phone` in the **Custom Variations** field.
* Leaving all other options at their default settings, click **Save**.
