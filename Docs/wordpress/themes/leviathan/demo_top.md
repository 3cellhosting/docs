:   1. **Top - Logo** [13%, 9%, se]
    2. **Top - Gantry Login Form** [13%, 90%, sw]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Top section:

* Logo
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Login Form

#### Gantry Logo
The first thing you'll need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in the upper-left area of the front page as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

#### Gantry Divider
This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Login Form
The login form located on the top-right of the front page is actually a **Gantry Login Form** widget.
