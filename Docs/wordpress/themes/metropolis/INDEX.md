![][dropdown]
The Dropdown Menu is an advanced CSS driven dropdown menu system. It offers advanced structural features such as multiple columns, inline icons and text, custom column widths, item distribution and menu offsets. All of these are configurable for each menu item.

For mobile devices, a basic version of the Dropdown Menu will be used. It is activated by a custom menu icon in the top left of the screen. It will either be a tree view or select box menu, as configurable. All other sizes will use the menu's full version.

### Responsive Layout for RokSprocket
![][roksprocket]
Metropolis comes with the RokSprocket plugin which is built to work with a responsive layout and support mobile touch events, such as '**swipe**'. This is a modern way to display your site's featured content with minimal required effort on your part to maintain and update.

* Gantry Framework for WordPress 4.0.6+
* WordPress 3.2+
* PHP 5.2+

>> NOTE: Gantry v4.0.6+ is required for Metropolis to work correctly. For more details on the Gantry Framework, please visit its [Dedicated Website][gantry].

How to Install
-----
There are two primary methods used to install a theme by RocketTheme. You can download the theme files and associated plugins to install them on an existing site, or opt to go with RocketLauncher. 

What makes RocketLauncher an appealing solutions is that it includes everything you need to hit the ground running with your site. It comes complete with WordPress, a quick and easy database setup method, associated plugins, and plenty of pre-written content to help you get started with your site.

Whichever way you decide to go, RocketTheme is dedicated to making sure its products are easily updated and capable of running on all of the most common server solutions.

### Installing the Theme
Metropolis requires the Gantry framework in order to run on your site. This plugin is available via the same [download][download] site as the theme, and should be installed and activated prior to installing Metropolis. You can find more detailed instructions on installing the Gantry framework [here][gantry_install].

#### Downloading the Theme Files
Installing the theme by way of the theme files and associated plugins is the most common way to get Metropolis on your site if you have existing content and widgets you wish to preserve. You can download all the files listed below by visiting the [Metropolis download page][download].

To install the theme, you need two files:

* **Metropolis Theme** (*rt_metropolis_wp.zip*) - This file is the standalone theme package you will use to install your theme into WordPress.
* **Gantry Plugin** (*gantry_wordpress_framework.zip*) - This file contains the Gantry Framework Plugin and it's required in order to have our themes working.

>> Please note that the Gantry plugin needs to be installed first and activated (doesn't apply to RocketLauncher).

#### Other Files
There are other files that you may wish to download that accompany the release, but are not required for the theme to work.

* **Metropolis Source PNG(s)** (*rt_metropolis_wp-sources.zip*) - This contains all the Adobe Fireworks PNG source files for the theme, and if applicable, the logo font.
* **Metropolis RocketLauncher** (*rt_metropolis_wp-rocketlauncher.zip*) - The RocketLauncher pack is a full WordPress install that contains all the demo content, including plugins and the theme.

#### Installing Using the WordPress Installer
* Log in into the WordPress administrative dashboard (*http://www.yoursite.com/wp-admin/*).
* In the left menu sidebar, go to **Appearance → Add New Themes → Upload**.
* Select the **Choose File** button.
* Locate the **rt_metropolis_wp.zip** file on your computer.
* Click **Install Now**.
* Metropolis will now be installed.
* Click **Activate** under the Metropolis theme.

#### Installing Using FTP
* Extract **rt_metropolis_wp**.
* Load your FTP client, such as [FileZilla][filezilla].
* Upload the **rt_metropolis_wp** folder to the **/wp-content/themes** directory.
* Log in into the WordPress administrator dashboard (*http://www.yoursite.com/wp-admin/*).
* In the left menu sidebar, go to **Appearance → Themes**.
* Click **Activate** underneath the Metropolis section.

### RocketLauncher
>> RocketLauncher includes a FULL WordPress install, in addition to the theme and demo contents. The WordPress installation process is necessary in creating the demo content, therefore RocketLauncher will only work properly as a new WordPress installation. It can not be used on an existing WordPress installation.

* Download the Metropolis RocketLauncher Package (rt_metropolis_wp_rocketlauncher.zip) from the Metropolis [theme downloads section][download].
* Unzip the zip packaged onto your computer to reveal the rt_metropolis_wp_rocketlauncher folder.
* Upload this to your site using your FTP client.
* Direct your browser to the installation directory. For example: **www.yoursite.com/rt_metropolis_wp_rocketlauncher**. 
* Follow the standard WordPress installation, after which the theme and gantry framework will automatically be activated, along with the associated sample content.

More detailed instructions on setting up RocketLauncher can be found in our [RocketLauncher documentation][launcher].
