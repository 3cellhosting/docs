Copyright Section
-----

![][demo2]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Divider
* Text
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry To Top

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Text

The Text widget in the section is very simple. You will need to enter the following in the main text field.

~~~
<span class="copytext">&copy; 2012 Fresco - Designed by RocketTheme<br />Powered by Gantry Framework</span>
~~~

Here is a breakdown of options changes you will want to make to match the demo.

* Leaving everything at its default setting, select **Save**.

#### Gantry Divider
This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
