:   1. **Gantry Breadcrumbs** [35%, 6%, se]
    2. **Gantry Social Buttons** [35%, 85%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Top section:

* Gantry Breadcrumbs
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Social Buttons

#### Gantry Breadcrumbs

The **Gantry Breadcrumbs** widget gives you the ability to present page-aware breadcrumbs on the page. All you need to do to add them is to drag the **Gantry Breadcrumbs** widget from the **Available Widgets** area to the **Breadcrumbs** widget position.

Here is a breakdown of the settings we used:

| Option            | Setting                                                    |
| :----------       | :----------                                                |
| Widget Variations | Increase Top (10px), Increase Bottom (10px), No Margin All |
| Custom Variations | `hidden-phone`                                             |

>> NOTE: Because the front page is the root of the site, the breadcrumbs widget does not appear visible on that page, however it does appear on subpages.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site.

Here is a breakdown of the settings we used:

| Field       | Setting                                          |
| :---------- | :----------                                      |
