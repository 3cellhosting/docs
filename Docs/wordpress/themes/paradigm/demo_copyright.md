:   1. **Gantry Copyright** [35%, 7%, se]
    2. **Gantry Social Buttons** [35%, 55%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Copyright
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Social Buttons

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site.
