Where can I find theme settings?
-----
* Log in to the WordPress administrative dashboard at http://www.yoursite.com/wp-admin/
* Select the **Crystalline Settings** sidebar tab on the left of the dashboard.
* For more information visit our [Gantry documentation](http://docs.gantry.org/gantry4/configure) on the settings menu.

How do I change the logo?
-----

The logo used in **Crystalline** is a png file named `logo.png` located in `/wp-content/themes/rt_crystalline_wp/images/logo/`. The logo we used is 250 × 65 pixels. You can create your own logo and replace this file with it. Once you have created your own logo and named it `logo.png`, follow these steps to upload them to your server. 

If you are using a remote server, we recommend using your preferred FTP, SFTP, etc. program. The directory listing mentioned below is relative to the root of the WordPress installation.

* Navigate to the `/wp-content/themes/rt_crystalline_wp/images/logo/` directory.
* Upload `logo.png` (and any other logo related images) to this directory (You may need to browse on the local panel in the FTP client to find where you have exported your logo).
* Clear your browser cache before viewing such as using the keyboard commands on Windows, `Ctrl+F5`.
