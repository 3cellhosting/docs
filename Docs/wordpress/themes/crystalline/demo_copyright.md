:	1. **Gantry Copyright** [30%, 7%, se]
	2. **Gantry Reset Settings** [60%, 45%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Copyright
* Gantry Reset Settings

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it is preserved as a Default widget override.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`. 

#### Gantry Reset Settings

The **Gantry Reset Settings** widget gives users the option to revert any changes made using the **Gantry Color Chooser** to their default settings set by the administrator in the backend. The **Reset Settings Text** field has `Reset Settings` in it.
