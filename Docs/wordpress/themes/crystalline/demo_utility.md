![][demo]

:   1. **RokAjaxSearch** [35%, 8%, se]
    2. **Gantry Login Button** [35%, 72%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Utility section:

* RokAjaxSearch
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Login Button

#### RokAjaxSearch

The RokAjaxSearch widget allows users to search your site for interesting content. Here is a breakdown of the options you will want to change to match the demo.

Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Login Button

The **Gantry Login Button** widget activates the **Login** pop-up which allows members to log in to their accounts on the frontend of the site. Simply drag this widget to the widget section (there's a separate widget section for the **Gantry Login Form**) and complete the following to replicate the demo.

* Enter `Member Login` in the **Login Text** field.
* Enter `Logout` in the **Logout Text** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**. 

This button doesn't do anything if there isn't a widget in the **Popup** widget position. In our demo, we use the **Gantry Login Form** widget. Below are the settings used in our demo.

#### Gantry Login Form

The login form located on the front page is actually a **Gantry Login Form** widget. Here are the widget options you will need to change in order to match the demo.

| Option        | Setting     |
| :----------   | :---------- |
| Title         | `Login`     |
| User Greeting | Hi,         |
| Pre-text      | Blank       |
| Post-text     | Blank       |
