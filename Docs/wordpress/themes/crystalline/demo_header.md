:   1. **Gantry Logo** [30%, 8%, se]
    2. **Gantry ColorChooser** [30%, 76%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry ColorChooser

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in the upper-left area of the front page as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

In this instance, the **Per Style Logo** option is selected.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry ColorChooser

![][colorchooser]

The **Gantry ColorChooser** widget enables users to quickly switch between preset color schemes and select custom colors from the frontend of your site. This is a tool best used during site setup as it gives you a quick and easy method of comparing different color schemes and other visual options before setting them as the permanent default in the **Theme Settings** area of the backend.

In this instance, we entered `Color Chooser` in the **Text** field.
