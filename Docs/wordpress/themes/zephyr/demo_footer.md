#### Gantry Font Sizer

The **Gantry Font Sizer** widget gives your visitors the ability to adjust the size of the font as it appears on the page. The options used in the demo are listed below.

| Option          | Setting     |
| :-------------- | :---------- |
| Font Sizer Text | `Font Size` |

All other options are either left blank or set to their default.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it. We entered `Scroll To Top` in the **To Top Text** field.
