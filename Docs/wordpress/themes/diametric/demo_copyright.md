Copyright Section

![][demo2]

Here's the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Branding
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry To Top

The Copyright section remains the same for all areas of the site. Because of this, it's preserved as a Default widget override. 

#### Gantry To Top
The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
