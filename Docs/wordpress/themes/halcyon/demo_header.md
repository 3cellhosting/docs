![][demo]

:   1. **Header - Gantry Logo** [35%, 7%, se]
    2. **Header - RokAjaxSearch** [35%, 93%, sw]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Divider
* RokAjaxSearch

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in as it does in the demo.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### RokAjaxSearch

The RokAjaxSearch widget allows users to search your site for interesting content. Here is a breakdown of the options you will want to change to match the demo.

Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.
