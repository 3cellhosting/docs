:   1. **Header - Gantry Logo** [30%, 7%, se]
    2. **Header - Gantry Menu** [30%, 35%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Menu

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in as it does in the demo.

Here is a breakdown of options changes you will want to make to match the demo.

* Check **Per Style Logo**.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Menu

The Gantry Menu widget should be set to match your site's main menu as it serves as the primary menu widget for the entire site. You can customize this menu by navigating to **Administration -> Appearance -> Menus** and creating or modifying your selected menu there.

Here is a breakdown of the widget options for this menu widget. Any options not present in this breakdown are left at default and should not be adjusted.
