Here is the widget breakdown for the Controls section:

* Gantry Font Sizer
* Gantry Login Button

#### Gantry Date

The **Gantry Date** widget displays the current date for visitors. The options used in the demo are listed below.

| Option           | Setting                     |  
| :--------------- | :-------------------------- |  
| Client Side Date | Unchecked                   |  
| Date Format      | Tuesday, September 23, 2014 |  

All other options are either left blank or set to their default.

#### Gantry Font Sizer

The **Gantry Font Sizer** widget gives your visitors the ability to adjust the size of the font as it appears on the page. The options used in the demo are listed below.

| Option          | Setting     |  
| :-------------- | :---------- |  
| Font Sizer Text | `Font Size` |  

All other options are either left blank or set to their default.

#### Gantry Login Button and Gantry Login Form

The **Gantry Login Button** widget activates the **Login** pop-up which allows members to log in to their accounts on the frontend of the site. Simply drag this widget to the widget section (there's a separate widget section for the **Gantry Login Form**) and complete the following to replicate the demo.

* Enter `Login` in the **Login Text** field.
* Enter `Logout` in the **Logout Text** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

The login form that appears when you click the **Gantry Login Button** is actually a **Gantry Login Form** widget. Here are the widget options you will need to change in order to match the demo. In this case, the widget has been placed in the **Login** widget position.

| Option        | Setting      |  
| :------------ | :----------- |  
| Title         | `Login Form` |  
| User Greeting | Hi,          |  
| Pre-text      | Blank        |  
| Post-text     | Blank        |
