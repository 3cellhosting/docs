:   1. **Gantry Logo** [30%, 8%, se]
    2. **Gantry Links** [30%, 67%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Divider
* Gantry Links

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in the upper-left area of the front page as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Links

The **Gantry Links** widget is used to display links in a way that works natively with the Gantry framework. It is a great alternative to the default WordPress blogroll widget. Links are controlled via the native **Links** feature in WordPress. You will find the options used in our demo below.
