Here is the widget breakdown for the Header section:

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. Once this is done, the logo should appear in as it does in the demo. You can further customize this logo by following the instructions in our [FAQ][faq].

In this instance, the **Per Style Logo** option has been checked.
