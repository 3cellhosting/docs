Navigation Section

:   1. **Gantry Logo** [30%, 8%, se]
    2. **Gantry Menu** [30%, 47%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Navigation section:

* Gantry Logo
* Gantry Menu

The Navigation section remains the same across the entire demo site. For this reason, it exists in the default **Widget Override** menu. It is also a fairly simple section to set up.

#### Gantry Logo

The first thing you will need to do is click and drag the **Gantry Logo** widget from the **Available Widgets** area of the Widgets menu to the appropriate section. We also checked the **Per Style Logo** option. Once this is done, the logo should appear in as it does in the demo.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Menu
The Gantry Menu widget should be set to match your site's main menu as it serves as the primary menu widget for the entire site. You can customize this menu by navigating to **Administration -> Appearance -> Menus** and creating or modifying your selected menu there. 

Here is a breakdown of the widget options for this menu widget. Any options not present in this breakdown are left at default and should not be adjusted.
