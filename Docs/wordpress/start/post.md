Introduction
-----

WordPress uses **posts** and **pages**, with additional support from **widgets**, to make up the bulk of your site's content. 

Posts appear in your site's RSS feed, and generally make up the rotating content of your site. This is where your blog entries, articles, and updates would generally go. Posts can be sorted into categories, with each category receiving its own RSS feed. A technology news site might have posts in multiple categories including: Mobile, Televisions, Hardware, Software, Reviews, etc. 

Pages, on the other hand, are mostly used for static supporting content that is frequently referenced and/or easily linked throughout your site. An *About Us* page would be a prime example of the type of content that would go into pages, rather than posts.

Widgets make up blocks of content on your site, apart from the main content body filled by pages and/or posts. Items in the sidebar, the menus, social media buttons, and a search form are typical examples of content found in widgets.

In this guide, we will explain how to create a new post using WordPress' integrated editing tools.

Step 1: Add a New Post

There are two main ways to initiate the creation of a new post in WordPress. Both of these methods will take you to the same edit screen. There may be additional options available to you through modifications made by plugins, and/or site customization.

The first, and most accessible way involves using the administrative toolbar that appears at the top of each page once you are logged in to the site. This bar is typically available on the frontend and backend of WordPress. Simply select the **+ New** option to open the editor and begin writing.

The second method for creating a new post requires you to navigate to **Posts -> Add New** from the sidebar in the backend.
