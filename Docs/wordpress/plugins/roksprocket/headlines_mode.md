:   1. **Title** This is the title of your widget. [16%, 10%, se]
    2. **Filtered Article List Options** Gives you access to item-specific settings for the articles title, description, image, and link. [53%, 48%, nw]
    3. **Layout Type** This is where you will select the Layout Mode you wish to use for your RokSprocket widget. [46%, 82%, nw]
    4. **Content Filter Rules** Sets the content filter rules for the widget. [54%, 80%, sw]

1. The **Title** field gives you the ability to set a title for the widget itself. Every widget has to have a title, though you can opt to hide it from public view for a cleaner, more template integrated look. The **Position** field right below it gives you the ability to set the position within the template's layout the widget should appear in.

2. The **Filtered Article List** gives you access to item-specific settings including:
    * **Image** - This allows you to circumvent the assigned image from the article and replace it with one specifically for the headline. 
    * **Link** - If set, the link will show a *Read More** button as well as link the title. On specific themes, it will link the image in the headline, as well.
    * **Description** - Allows you to set a description for the headline. If this is left at *Default* the introtext from the article is used. 

3. The **Content Provider and Layout Type** section gives you the ability to set the Layout Mode you wish to use for the widget. This is often the first setting you want to pay attention to when creating a new RokSprocket widget. The Content Provider can vary, but in most Joomla instances, this will default to Joomla.

4. The **Content Filter Rules** section gives you the ability to determine how the widget will pull content to make up the headlines. For example, you can have the widget pull articles that are within a specific category, contain a particular name or keyword in the title, or choose specific articles. You can also modify how this content is sorted in the widget.
