Logging In with RokUpdater
-----
RokUpdater allows you to log in once and manage all of the updates for supported RocketTheme extensions from the Extension Update Manager inside the Joomla Administrator.

![][login_1]

Logging in is a simple process and can be done within the Update Manager accessed by going to **Administrator -> Extensions -> Extension Manager -> Update** and selecting the **RocketTheme Login** button (pictured above).

![][login_2]

From there, you will be asked to log in to your RocketTheme account with the same credentials you would use to access [RocketTheme.com][rockettheme] website directly. If you have forgotten or misplaced your username or password, you can select the appropriate link(s) above the **Authenticate** button to initiate the retrieval process. These links will take you directly to [RocketTheme.com][rockettheme].

![][login_3]

Once authenticated, the yellow authentication bar will be replaced with a blue one (displayed above) indicating which RocketTheme clubs you have been authenticated with. At this point, you should be able to seek out and initiate updates for both club and free supported extensions.

Plug-in Manager Settings

RokUpdater gives you the ability to hide or display the RocketTheme authentication state in the Update manager. This is useful if you wish to grant access to the update manager to certain users without necessarily making them aware of which club(s) or user names the primary account administrator is signed in through. The authentication state will always be displayed in the Plug-in Manager.

Additionally, you can opt to hide updates that are presently unavailable from the update screen. This step further reduces any potential confusion that might occur.

:   1. **Extension Type** A symbol appearing in this column indicates an update's ability to be applied given the current conditions of RokUpdater and the Joomla site. [40%, 53%]
    2. **Update** Once you've selected the desired plugin(s) you wish to update, simply select the **Update** button as you would with any other extension. [15%, 4%]

1. **Extension Type** A symbol appearing in this column indicates one of three things.
	* A blue plus (+) indicates a free RocketTheme extension. 
	* A green check mark indicates a club extension that your authenticated account can freely update. 
	* A red x is indicative of a club RocketTheme extension that your currently logged-in account does not have the ability to update. It could also indicate that your present Joomla configuration does not support the updated extension.
2. Once you've selected the desired plugin(s) you wish to update, simply select the **Update** button as you would with any other extension.

Once an extension has been successfully applied, you should receive a confirmation message similar to the one above.
