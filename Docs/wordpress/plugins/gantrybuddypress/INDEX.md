How to install
--------------

Installing Gantry BuddyPress takes just a matter of few minutes.

The first thing you'll need to do is [download][download] the latest version of Gantry BuddyPress. The package you will download contains everything you need to get Gantry BuddyPress up and running and it is compatible with WordPress 3.2 or higher. It does not need to be uncompressed. 

Once you've downloaded the package, go into the WordPress Administrator and:

From WordPress 3.x:

* Select from the top menu: `wp-admin -> Plugins -> Add New -> Upload`
* Click on the **Choose File** button
* Select the `gantry-buddypress.zip` that you just downloaded from your local drive.
* Click the **Install Now** button.

Once installation is complete, you'll receive a message (shown above) indicating that the plugin was installed successfully. To activate Gantry BuddyPress right away, select **Activate Plugin** from this confirmation page.

>> NOTE: RocketTheme packages can be updated by uploading the new plugin and/or theme files via FTP, replacing the ones that currently exist on the server. Alternatively, you can remove the existing plugin directory you'd like to update via FTP and upload the new package through the backend Installation tool. Deleting a plugin and replacing it using only the Plugin Manager can cause plugin settings to be lost. In either case, we recommend deactivating the plugin or theme prior to replacing its files.
