Introduction
-----

Creating products in Magento is a major step towards getting your e-commerce site ready for launch. Products are the meat and potatoes of your store, and everything else is there to make them look good, and put sales on your books.

Unfortunately, the product creation process isn't as simple as filling out a form and uploading a photo. You have to take a few steps before you create that product in order to prevent headaches down the road.

For example, you should already have created attributes and attribute sets for your products before reaching this point. Why? What good is creating a product if you don't have specs to assign to it? If you have just one attribute set and a large variety of product types, then you'll be stuck using the same set of variables for every product you create. You can't assign an existing product a new attribute set, and this often causes a lot of confusion to new users.
