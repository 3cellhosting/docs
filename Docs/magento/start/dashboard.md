Introduction
-----

The Magento **Dashboard** is the default home page in the **Admin Panel** of Magento. It serves as a quick snapshot of your site's activity and performance. You can check your sales numbers, view graphs of order activity, see frequently used search terms within the site, and find out what your customers are viewing.

All of this information is available at a glance, so you don't have to dig into the menu system to find these various bits and pieces.

You don't have to use the **Dashboard** as your administrative home page. You can choose an alternative page to load when you first access the **Admin Panel** by going to **System -> Configuration -> Advanced -> Admin** and changing the option there.

The **Dashboard** is made up of several information sections that provide a variety of information. Graphs, a large part of the default Dashboard page, can be turned on and/or off by visting the configuration options in **System -> Configuration -> Advanced -> Admin -> Dashboard** and turning the **Enable Charts** option on or off.

At the top of the Dashboard is the **Choose Store View** option. This option gives you quick access to the store you wish to access information for in your dashboard. If your site hosts multiple categorical stores, or perhaps a store for each supported language, then this is where you can switch between them.

#### Lifetime Sales

The **Lifetime Sales** area of the **Dashboard** gives you a quick total of the total sales for the lifetime of your Magento site. 

#### Average Orders

This area of the Dashboard displays the average order amount for individual orders placed through your site.

#### Last 5 Orders

This list gives you the five most recently placed orders in your store. Customer information, items ordered, and the order totals are included.
