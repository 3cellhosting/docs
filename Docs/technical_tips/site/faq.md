How Can I Change my Avatar?

Your forum avatar is linked to your RocketTheme.com profile. You can change it by navigating to your **Forum Profile** settings page by selecting your profile image at the top of any page on the RocketTheme site and clicking **User Profile**.

You will need to be logged in for this option to appear, so you can alternatively select the blue **Login** button above the menu bar before doing so.

You can also access this page by clicking [this link][profile].

Once you have accessed the page, you can add your own avatar by selecting **Choose File** under **Upload New Avatar**. Once you have selected the image file you wish you use, simply upload it and the change should be made to your account.

How do I Find More Information About Orders I Have Made?

![][dropdown]

Let's say you want to print a copy of the invoice for a previous purchase from RocketTheme. You can do this by going to your profile's **Order History** page. You can do this by selecting your profile at the top of any RocketTheme site page and selecting **Order History** from the drop-down list. You can also access the page by clicking [this link][history].

![][orders]

From there, you will see a list of previous orders. You can see the date, Invoice ID, Item(s) purchased, total, and print directly from this page. The **Print** button will send you to a page with a printer-friendly version of the entire invoice for the selected order.

When Does My Club Membership Expire?
-----

You can find the activation and expiration date of your current Club memberships by visiting the **Purchases** page of your profile. This page can be accessed directly through the main account drop-down menu at the top of each RocketTheme site page. You can also access this page by clicking [this link][purchases].

![][expire]

Here, you can see your subscriptions, their start and expiry date, the amount of site licenses included, and have the option to renew and/or purchase new memberships.

How Do I Use Search?
-----

Our site is equipped with an extremely powerful search feature built on Elasticsearch. You can access it any time by clicking the **Search RocketTheme** field in the upper-left area of each page on the site. You can search directly from this field. You can also do some platform-level filtering by selecting the filter icon and choosing the platform you wish to search for.

![][search1]

:   1. **Filter** The filter allows you to quickly jump to results for a specific platform. [10%, 15%, se]
    2. **Search Icon** Clicking this, or hitting **Enter** will take you to the main **Search** page. [10%, 52%, se]

If you want more control over your search, you can hit **Enter** after typing in your desired search term and refine it using the **Filter by Platform** and **Filter by Type** options below the main field on the **Search** page.

![][search2]

:   1. **Filter** The filter allows you to quickly jump to results for a specific platform and/or page type. [47%, 36%, se]
