Introduction
-----

RocketTheme's forum is the central community hub for finding and sharing information, receiving support, and communicating with other members of the community. It is a great place to go if you need advice or tips concerning RocketTheme products.

As with any forum, there are recommended practices in place that make it easier to find the answers you need. Below, we have outlined some tips to help you make the most of the RocketTheme forum.

### Let Search Help You Find Answers

:   1. **Search by Keyword** This field allows you to search by keyword or phrase. [16%, 10%, se]
    2. **Search by User Name** Enter a user name here to pull up threads and replies from that user. [16%, 50%, se]
    3. **Advanced Search** Options that appear here enable you to further refine your search to include specific categories, post types, and other variables to help you narrow down the results. [22%, 10%, se]

RocketTheme has a powerful site-wide search tool in place to help you find what you are looking for in seconds. This tool works remarkably well for finding forum topics, and with over 200,000 subjects already on the RocketTheme forum, there is a good chance the answer you are searching for is already available.

By selecting **Search Forum** from the forum menu, you can search for the forum thread of your choice by keyword or user name. These results can be further filtered and sorted by category, posting date range, score, title, view count, and more.

### Ask the Right Questions

It can be very difficult to determine the best answer for someone if their question is broad, and without necessary information. Your topic title should be clear and concise, and your supporting text should outline the situation you are facing in as much detail as you can provide.

#### Choose the Right Category

![][categoryselection]

:   1. **New Topic** This button allows you to create a new topic within the presently-selected forum category. [84%, 59%, se]

RocketTheme's moderators regularly check for new questions and follow-up inquiries from members on several different categories. Just about every product RocketTheme produces has at least one dedicated sub-category, with many of those having sections dedicated to solved issues and/or tutorials.

If you have a question or issue that is not already answered in the **Solved Threads** sub-category, you can ask a new one from the primary category by selecting the blue **New Topic** button within the category's index page.

For example, if you have a question about the Joomla Anacron template, you would need to navigate to the primary **Anacron** category under **Joomla** and select **New Topic**. 

#### Give Your Topic an Appropriate Title

The title of your topic makes a big difference on how it is found and responded to by moderators and other members of the RocketTheme community. Use this space to poise your question in a brief, yet comprehensive way.

For the interest of this example, we will assume the user is attempting to get some help changing the logo on their website.

Here are a few examples of topic titles that are less likely to be properly discovered and answered:

* This isn't Working!!!
* Help me, PLEASE!
* Logo Broken

Here is an example of how the topic title can be worded in a way that makes it easy for someone to find and answer:

* How Do I Change the Site Logo in Anacron for Joomla 2.5?

This single sentence tells a moderator and/or community member everything they need to know to get a clear idea of what it is this topic is about. If someone else is searching for the same solution later on, it will be easy for them to find.

Our moderators are actively searching for questions that need to be answered throughout the forums. By titling the topics in a way that makes it easy for them to identify an issue, they can quickly provide relevant information and/or forward them to someone that can provide insight.

#### Give Detailed Information in the Body of Your Post

Sometimes, issues can be a bit more complex than a single question can handle. You have the ability to be as specific as you need to be when you post a new topic. Any relevant information you can share here that does not put your site at any security risk will help someone to give you a quick and thorough answer.

When it comes to a process as complicated as site development, leaving a lot of room for interpretation in your question can lead to confusion. Explain exactly what you want to accomplish, as well as any steps you have taken so far. 

This will improve your chances of receiving the answer you need without having to engage in a lot of back-and-forth discussion as troubleshooters run down the list of possible solutions.

Here are four questions that should be answered in the body of your topic's initial post.

* What is Your Current Situation?
* What Would You Like to Accomplish?
* What Solutions Have You Tried So Far?
* What Were the Results of these Attempts?

If these four questions are answered, you will be far more likely to receive the answers you need in a timely manner. 

It can also be very helpful to provide information about the server and platform. Which version of PHP is running, the version number of the RocketTheme product (if applicable), the browser(s) affected by a frontend display issue, any error codes that appear, and any other relevant information can be very useful in providing accurate support.

Screenshots and URLs can be helpful as well.

### Remember to Mark Your Message as Solved

Once you have received an answer to your question, you can mark your topic as **Solved** by editing the topic title and adding either `[Solved]` or `(Solved)` at the beginning. This will give the topic a badge in the list that lets moderators know to move your topic to the **Solved** category.

This makes it easier for future users to find solutions to the same issue you faced. It makes the whole forum easier to navigate and use as it frees up more people to answer new and pressing issues rather than answer the same question numerous times.

### Check Documentation

Most of the information regarding standard practices such as replicating a template's demo content, installing and updating products, and setting up a site using RocketTheme extensions or templates can be found directly in RocketTheme's documentation. 

These guides are complete with images, step-by-step instructions, and other useful information written for users at any level of experience. Even if you are installing and running WordPress, Joomla, Magento, or phpBB for the first time, our documentation should have plenty of useful information to help you get started.
